The border radius of extension popups is only applied when the background color of both the body and html tags is transparent.

When this is the case on load, the radius border is displayed behind the view. If later on a background is applied, it will be displayed on top of the corners which will kind of hide them.

When this is not the case, square corders are applied always.
